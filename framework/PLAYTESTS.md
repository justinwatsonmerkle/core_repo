# Playtests (anonymised)

Purpose: capture what actually happened when the framework was used, without sharing personal content.

## How to anonymise
Do not include:
- names
- company/client identifiers
- sensitive metrics or incident details

Do include:
- persona band (IC / Senior IC / Manager / Leader)
- track focus (promotion / stability / external / exploration)
- time budget (low / medium / high)
- what worked / what failed
- where prompts were confusing
- which artefacts were useful (and which were ignored)
