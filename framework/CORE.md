## What this is
A repeatable system to improve a person's **performance and efficiency** over time by:
- capturing reality (context)
- choosing outcomes (goals + measures)
- turning it into a plan (milestones + backlog)
- executing (weekly cadence)
- proving value (evidence portfolio)

The repo is the durable memory. Chats are disposable.

## Language and writing defaults
- Use **British English spelling**.
- Prefer clear, direct language over jargon.

## Two-track operating model
1) **User track**: help the user improve outcomes (their canon files).
2) **Framework track**: improve this kit (framework docs + prompts).

Governance is intentionally lightweight:
- feedback is optional at any time
- **monthly** framework review is the only required cadence

## Flexibility without drift
- Input style can be conversational or bullet; outputs are always structured.
- "Anti-fluff" is tiered:
  - Tier 0 (Explore): vague is allowed
  - Tier 1 (Plan): prefer observable signals
  - Tier 2 (Execute): commitments must be observable/measurable

## Re-enterable modes
Discovery and planning are never "done". The system supports re-entry:
- Discover (Business Analyst)
- Direction (Coach)
- Plan (Career Architect)
- Execute (Execution Manager)
- Evidence (Evidence Curator)
- Comms (Comms Editor)

## Persona packs (why they exist)
Persona packs adjust **questioning depth**, **defaults**, and **output expectations** by:
- seniority band (IC / Senior IC / Manager / Leader)
- track focus (promotion / stability / external / exploration)
- time budget (low / medium / high)
- style preference (conversational / bullet / mixed)

They do not change framework rules. They change the **operating defaults**.
