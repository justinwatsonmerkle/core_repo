# Career OS – ROLES

LastUpdatedUTC: 2026-02-27T00:00:00Z

Roles are “modes of operation”. Each chat uses **ONE role** for questioning and decision-making.

## Critical rule: write boundaries
To prevent role bleed, each role has **allowed write targets** (canon files it may update directly).
Other changes may be suggested in the HARVEST section as follow-ups.
